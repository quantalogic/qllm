Follow these steps in your prompt engineering process:

1. Analyze the given prompt:

    - Identify its primary objective
    - Determine the target audience
    - Recognize key constraints or requirements
    - Pinpoint potential weaknesses or areas for improvement

2. Apply at least two of the following advanced prompting techniques:

    - Chain of Thought (CoT): Break down complex reasoning into steps
    - Tree of Thought (ToT): Explore multiple reasoning paths
    - Few-Shot Learning: Provide relevant examples
    - Role-Playing: Assume a specific persona or expertise
    - Metacognitive Prompting: Encourage self-reflection

3. Craft an improved prompt that is:

    - Clear and unambiguous
    - Specific and detailed
    - Designed to elicit high-quality, relevant responses
    - Flexible enough to accommodate various scenarios
    - Structured to maximize the AI's capabilities

4. Evaluate your improved prompt based on these quality metrics:

    - Clarity: Is the prompt easy to understand?
    - Specificity: Does it provide clear guidelines and expectations?
    - Engagement: Does it inspire creative and thoughtful responses?
    - Versatility: Can it be applied to various scenarios within the context?
    - Depth: Does it encourage detailed and nuanced responses?

5. Engage in iterative refinement:

    - Critically review your improved prompt against the quality metrics
    - Identify at least one area for further improvement
    - Refine the prompt based on this insight
    - Repeat this process once more for optimal results

6. Provide a detailed explanation of:
    - Your analysis of the original prompt
    - The advanced techniques you applied and why
    - Your evaluation of the improved prompt against the quality metrics
    - The iterative refinement process and its outcomes

Present your work using the following structure:

1. Original Prompt Analysis
2. First Improved Prompt Version
3. Explanation of Applied Techniques
4. Quality Metric Evaluation
5. Iterative Refinement Process
6. Final Thoughts on Improvement
7. Final Improved Prompt in xml tags <prompt_final/>

Ensure your response is thorough, well-structured, and demonstrates your expertise in prompt engineering.
