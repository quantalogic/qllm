# Simple Agent System Specification v 1.0

## Overview

The Simple Agent System allows users to create, manage, and interact with AI agents using the QLLM CLI. Each agent has a unique name, a system prompt that defines its behavior and expertise, and a specific model configuration. Users can engage in conversations with these agents, either directly or by mentioning them during an ongoing chat session.

## Agent Structure

Agents are defined using YAML files with the following structure:

```yaml
name: product_designer
version: 1.0.0
description: An AI agent specialized in product design and user experience
author: Jane Smith
created: 2024-07-03
last_modified: 2024-07-03
system_prompt: |
  You are an expert product designer with a focus on user experience and interface design. 
  Your role is to assist with product conceptualization, user research, prototyping, and design critiques. 
  Always consider user needs, market trends, and accessibility in your responses.
model:
  provider: anthropic
  name: claude-3-opus-20240229
parameters:
  max_tokens: 1000
  temperature: 0.7
  top_p: 1
  top_k: 250
```

## Features

### 1. Agent Management

- Create new agents
- Edit existing agents
- Delete agents
- List available agents

Commands:
```
qllm agent create <name>
qllm agent edit <name>
qllm agent delete <name>
qllm agent list
```

### 2. Agent Interaction

- Start a conversation with a specific agent
- Switch between agents during a conversation using @mentions

Commands:
```
qllm chat --agent <name>
```

In-chat command:
```
@<agent_name> <message>
```

### 3. Agent Versioning

- Support for agent versioning
- Ability to revert to previous versions

Command:
```
qllm agent version <name> [--list|--revert <version>]
```

### 4. Agent Sharing

- Export agents for sharing
- Import agents from files or URLs

Commands:
```
qllm agent export <name> [--format yaml|json]
qllm agent import <file_or_url>
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Agent Storage

- Store agent definitions in `~/.qllm/agents/` as YAML files
- Use a SQLite database for quick querying and analytics

### 2. Agent Parser

- Develop a YAML parser to read and validate agent definitions
- Implement a system to load agents dynamically during runtime

### 3. Conversation Manager

- Create a conversation manager that can switch between agents
- Implement context preservation when switching agents

### 4. Model Integration

- Integrate with various LLM providers (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI)
- Implement a model configuration system that respects each agent's settings

### 5. CLI Enhancements

- Modify existing `qllm chat` command to support agent selection
- Implement in-chat agent switching using @mentions

### 6. Error Handling

- Provide clear error messages for invalid agent configurations
- Implement graceful error handling for network issues or API failures

## Implementation Steps

1. Design and implement the agent YAML structure
2. Develop the agent management system (CRUD operations)
3. Implement the agent parser and validator
4. Create the conversation manager with agent switching capabilities
5. Integrate various LLM providers and implement the model configuration system
6. Enhance the CLI to support agent-based interactions
7. Implement agent versioning system
8. Develop export and import functionality for agents
9. Create comprehensive error handling and user feedback systems
10. Write unit tests and integration tests
11. Develop user documentation and tutorials
12. Conduct user acceptance testing and gather feedback
13. Refine and optimize based on initial user experiences

## User Experience

1. Creating an Agent:
   ```
   $ qllm agent create product_designer
   > Enter a description: An AI agent specialized in product design and user experience
   > Enter the system prompt: You are an expert product designer...
   > Select a model provider: anthropic
   > Select a model: claude-3-opus-20240229
   > Agent 'product_designer' created successfully!
   ```

2. Starting a Conversation:
   ```
   $ qllm chat --agent product_designer
   > Hello! I'm your product designer agent. How can I assist you today?
   User: Can you help me brainstorm ideas for a new mobile app?
   Agent: Certainly! I'd be happy to help you brainstorm ideas for a new mobile app...
   ```

3. Switching Agents Mid-conversation:
   ```
   User: @marketing_specialist How would you approach marketing this app idea?
   Marketing Specialist: Great question! To market this app effectively, we should consider...
   ```

## Conclusion

This Simple Agent System provides users with a flexible and powerful way to interact with specialized AI agents. By allowing easy creation, management, and interaction with these agents, users can leverage AI assistance tailored to specific domains or tasks. The system's ability to switch between agents during a conversation offers a seamless experience for complex projects that may require multiple areas of expertise. As this system evolves, we can consider adding features like agent collaboration, memory persistence across sessions, and integration with external tools and data sources.
