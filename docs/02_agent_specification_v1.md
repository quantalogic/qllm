├── __init__.py
├── search_tools/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── academic_search.py
│   └── web_search.py
├── math_tools/
│   ├── __init__.py

│   └── summarizer.py
└── weather_tools/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── weather_api.py
```

### 9.2 Plugin Definition

Each plugin module must include:

1. A `PLUGIN_MANIFEST` dictionary
2. One or more tool functions

Example of a basic plugin module (`academic_search.py`):

```python
PLUGIN_MANIFEST = {
    "name": "Academic Search",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Tools for searching academic papers",
    "author": "QLLM Team",
    "tools": ["search_academic_papers"]
}

def search_academic_papers(query: str, max_results: int = 5) -> list:
    """
    Search for academic papers on a given topic.
    
    Args:
        query (str): The search query
        max_results (int): Maximum number of results to return

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries containing paper information
    """
    # Implementation of the search functionality
    # This could be a simulated search for v1.0
    return [
        {"title": f"Paper {i} on {query}", "authors": f"Author {i}", "year": 2024}
        for i in range(1, max_results + 1)
    ]
```

### 9.3 API-Calling Plugin Example

Example of a plugin that calls an external API (`weather_api.py`):

```python
import os
import requests
from typing import Dict, Any

PLUGIN_MANIFEST = {
    "name": "Weather Tools",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Tools for fetching weather information",
    "author": "QLLM Team",
    "tools": ["get_current_weather"]
}

API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY")
BASE_URL = "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"

def get_current_weather(city: str, units: str = "metric") -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Get the current weather for a given city.
    
    Args:
        city (str): The name of the city
        units (str): The unit system to use (metric or imperial)

    Returns:
        dict: A dictionary containing weather information
    """
    if not API_KEY:
        raise ValueError("OpenWeatherMap API key is not set")

    params = {
        "q": city,
        "appid": API_KEY,
        "units": units
    }

    try:
        response = requests.get(BASE_URL, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()

        return {
            "city": data["name"],
            "temperature": data["main"]["temp"],
            "description": data["weather"][0]["description"],
            "humidity": data["main"]["humidity"],
            "wind_speed": data["wind"]["speed"]
        }
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        return {"error": f"Failed to fetch weather data: {str(e)}"}
```

### 9.4 Plugin Registration

Plugins are automatically discovered and registered when placed in the `plugins/` directory.

### 9.5 Plugin Management

```bash
qllm plugin list
qllm plugin info <plugin_name>
qllm plugin disable <plugin_name>
qllm plugin enable <plugin_name>
```

### 9.6 Built-in Plugins

1. search_tools: Academic and web search capabilities
2. math_tools: Statistical calculations and mathematical operations
3. utility_tools: Unit conversion, text summarization, and fact-checking
4. weather_tools: Current weather information retrieval

### 9.7 Plugin Development Guidelines

1. Each plugin should focus on a specific domain or set of related functionalities.
2. Plugins must include proper error handling and input validation.
3. Plugin developers should provide clear documentation for each tool function.
4. Plugins should be designed to be stateless to ensure consistency across conversations.
5. API-calling plugins should use environment variables for storing sensitive information like API keys.

### 9.8 Security Considerations for Plugins

1. Plugins are run in a sandboxed environment to prevent unauthorized system access.
2. The system performs a basic security scan of plugin code before loading.
3. Users must explicitly enable third-party plugins before they can be used.
4. API keys and other sensitive data should be stored securely and never exposed in plugin code.
5. All API calls should use HTTPS to ensure data encryption in transit.
6. Implement proper error handling to prevent exposure of sensitive information.

## 10. Security and Privacy

- All sensitive data (e.g., API keys) is encrypted at rest
- User authentication is required for accessing and managing agents
- Conversation data is not stored permanently unless explicitly requested by the user
- Regular security audits and updates are performed on the system

## 11. Error Handling and Logging

Error messages follow a standard format:
```
ERROR [timestamp] [error_code]: Detailed error message
```

Logging levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

## 12. CLI Commands

```bash
# Agent management
qllm agent create <name>
qllm agent edit <name>
qllm agent delete <name>
qllm agent list
qllm agent search <query>

# Template management
qllm template create <name>
qllm template list

# Chat interaction
qllm chat --agent <name>

# Plugin management
qllm plugin list
qllm plugin info <name>
qllm plugin disable <name>
qllm plugin enable <name>

# System management
