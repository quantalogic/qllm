# üöÄ QLLM: Simplifying Language Model Interactions

Welcome to QLLM, a project designed to streamline your interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). This monorepo contains two powerful packages:

1. üìö **qllm-lib**: A versatile TypeScript library for seamless LLM integration.
2. üñ•Ô∏è **qllm-cli**: A command-line interface for effortless LLM interactions.

## üåü Why QLLM and QLLM-LIB?

QLLM bridges the gap between cutting-edge language models and their practical implementation in business processes. Our goal is to make the power of generative AI accessible and actionable for businesses of all sizes.

QLLM-LIB provides a user-friendly AI toolbox that empowers developers to harness the potential of various LLMs through a single, unified interface. By simplifying interactions with these AI models, we aim to boost productivity and drive innovation across industries.

## üì¶ Packages

### qllm-lib

qllm-lib is a TypeScript library that offers a unified interface for interacting with various LLM providers. It simplifies working with different AI models and provides features like templating, streaming, and conversation management.

#### Practical Example

```typescript
import { createLLMProvider } from 'qllm-lib';

async function generateProductDescription() {
  const provider = createLLMProvider({ name: 'openai' });

  const result = await provider.generateChatCompletion({
    messages: [
      { 
        role: 'user', 
        content: { 
          type: 'text', 
          text: 'Write a compelling product description for a new smartphone with a foldable screen, 5G capability, and 48-hour battery life.' 
        } 
      },
    ],
    options: { model: 'gpt-4', maxTokens: 200 },
  });

  console.log('Generated Product Description:', result.text);
}

generateProductDescription();
```

This example demonstrates how to use qllm-lib to generate a product description, which could be useful for e-commerce platforms or marketing teams.

For more detailed information and advanced usage, check out the [qllm-lib README](./packages/qllm-lib/README.md).

### qllm-cli

qllm-cli is a command-line interface that leverages qllm-lib to provide easy access to LLM capabilities directly from your terminal.

#### Practical Example

```bash
# Generate a product description
qllm ask "Write a 50-word product description for a smart home security camera with night vision and two-way audio."

# Use a specific model for market analysis
qllm ask --model gpt-4o-mini --provider openai "Analyze the potential market impact of electric vehicles in the next 5 years. Provide 3 key points."

# Stream a response for real-time content generation
qllm ask --stream --model gemma2:2b --provider ollama "Write a short blog post about the benefits of remote work."

# Describe a picture
qllm ask --stream --model llava:latest --provider ollama "Describe the picture" -i "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Kowloon_Waterfront%2C_Hong_Kong%2C_2013-08-09%2C_DD_05.jpg/640px-Kowloon_Waterfront%2C_Hong_Kong%2C_2013-08-09%2C_DD_05.jpg"

# Chat
qllm chat --provider ollama --model gemma2:2b
```


These examples show how qllm-cli can be used for various business tasks, from content creation to market analysis.

For a complete list of commands and options, refer to the [qllm-cli README](./packages/qllm-cli/README.md).

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installing qllm-lib

To use qllm-lib in your project:

```bash
npm install qllm-lib
```

### Installing qllm-cli

To use qllm-cli globally:

```bash
npm install -g qllm
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Certainly! I'll rewrite the full updated documentation, incorporating the improvements while maintaining the original features and style. Here's the enhanced version:


### Quick Start

For experienced users who want to get up and running quickly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quantalogic/qllm.git
cd qllm
pnpm install
pnpm run build
pnpm run test
```

### Project Structure

This monorepo contains the following packages:

- `qllm-core`: Core functionality of the QLLM library
- `qllm-cli`: Command-line interface for QLLM
- (Add other packages as applicable)

Each package has its own `package.json`, source code, and tests.

### How to Use

This section provides comprehensive instructions on how to install, build, test, version, and publish the project.

#### Installation

To set up the project:

1. Ensure you have Node.js (‚â•16.5.0) and pnpm (‚â•6.0.0) installed.
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/quantalogic/qllm.git
   cd qllm
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

#### Building

To build all packages in the monorepo:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This command executes the build script for each package, compiling TypeScript and bundling with Rollup as configured.

#### Testing

Run tests across all packages:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

This executes test suites in each package, ensuring code quality and functionality.

#### Versioning and Changesets

This project uses Semantic Versioning (SemVer) and Changesets for version management.

##### Understanding Semantic Versioning

SemVer uses a three-part version number: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

- MAJOR: Incremented for incompatible API changes
- MINOR: Incremented for backwards-compatible new features
- PATCH: Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes

##### Creating a Changeset

1. Make code changes.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   pnpm changeset
   ```
3. Follow prompts to select modified packages and describe changes.

   Example:
   ```
   $ pnpm changeset
   ü¶ã  Which packages would you like to include? ¬∑ qllm-core, qllm-cli
   ü¶ã  Which packages should have a major bump? ¬∑ No items were selected
   ü¶ã  Which packages should have a minor bump? ¬∑ qllm-cli
   ü¶ã  Which packages should have a patch bump? ¬∑ qllm-core
   ü¶ã  Please enter a summary for this change (this will be in the changelogs).
   ü¶ã  Summary ¬∑ Added new CLI command and fixed core module bug
   ```

4. Commit the generated changeset file with your changes.

##### Updating Versions

To apply changesets and update versions:

```bash
pnpm run version
```

This command:
1. Analyzes changesets
2. Updates `package.json` files
3. Updates changelogs (CHANGELOG.md)
4. Removes changeset files

Example output:
```
Applying changesets
qllm-core patch
qllm-cli minor
All changesets applied!
```

##### Versioning in Monorepo

- Each package has its own version
- Inter-package dependencies are automatically updated
- Root `package.json` version represents the overall project version

#### Publishing

To publish packages:

1. Ensure the project is built:
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```
2. Run the publish command:
   ```bash
   pnpm run publish-packages
   ```

This publishes all packages to npm with public access.

### Additional Commands

- Linting: `pnpm run lint`
- Formatting: `pnpm run format`
- Cleaning build artifacts: `pnpm run clean`
- Installing CLI locally:
  ```bash
  pnpm run install:local
  ```
  This builds the project and installs `qllm-cli` globally from `packages/qllm-cli`.

### Best Practices

- Create a changeset for each significant change
- Use clear, concise descriptions in changesets
- Run `pnpm run version` before publishing
- Review changes in `package.json` and changelogs before committing

By following these practices, you ensure accurate version numbers and help users understand the impact of updates.

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. **Issue**: `pnpm install` fails
   **Solution**: Ensure you're using pnpm 6.0.0 or higher. Try clearing the pnpm cache with `pnpm store prune`.

2. **Issue**: Build fails with TypeScript errors
   **Solution**: Check that you're using a compatible TypeScript version (5.5.4 or compatible). Run `pnpm update typescript` to update.

3. **Issue**: Changesets not working
   **Solution**: Ensure @changesets/cli is installed correctly. Try reinstalling with `pnpm add -D @changesets/cli`.

### FAQ

Q: Can I use npm or yarn instead of pnpm?
A: While it's possible, we strongly recommend using pnpm for consistency and to avoid potential issues.

Q: How do I contribute to a specific package?
A: Navigate to the package directory in `packages/` and make your changes there. Ensure you create a changeset for your modifications.
