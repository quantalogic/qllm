# üöÄ QLLM: Simplifying Language Model Interactions

Welcome to QLLM, a project designed to streamline your interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs). This monorepo contains two powerful packages:

1. üìö qllm-lib: A versatile TypeScript library for seamless LLM integration
2. üñ•Ô∏è qllm-cli: A command-line interface for effortless LLM interactions

## üåü Why QLLM and QLLM-LIB?

QLLM bridges the gap between cutting-edge language models and their practical implementation in business processes. Our goal is to make the power of generative AI accessible and actionable for businesses of all sizes.

QLLM-LIB provides a user-friendly AI toolbox that empowers developers to harness the potential of various LLMs through a single, unified interface. By simplifying interactions with these AI models, we aim to boost productivity and drive innovation across industries.

## üì¶ Packages

### qllm-lib

qllm-lib is a TypeScript library that offers a unified interface for interacting with various LLM providers. It simplifies working with different AI models and provides features like templating, streaming, and conversation management.

#### Practical Example

```typescript
import { createLLMProvider } from 'qllm-lib';

async function generateProductDescription() {
  const provider = createLLMProvider({ name: 'openai' });

  const result = await provider.generateChatCompletion({
    messages: [
      { 
        role: 'user', 
        content: { 
          type: 'text', 
          text: 'Write a compelling product description for a new smartphone with a foldable screen, 5G capability, and 48-hour battery life.' 
        } 
      },
    ],
    options: { model: 'gpt-4', maxTokens: 200 },
  });

  console.log('Generated Product Description:', result.text);
}

generateProductDescription();
```

This example demonstrates how to use qllm-lib to generate a product description, which could be useful for e-commerce platforms or marketing teams.

For more detailed information and advanced usage, check out the [qllm-lib README](./packages/qllm-lib/README.md).

### qllm-cli

qllm-cli is a command-line interface that leverages qllm-lib to provide easy access to LLM capabilities directly from your terminal.

#### Practical Example

```bash
# Generate a product description
qllm ask "Write a 50-word product description for a smart home security camera with night vision and two-way audio."

# Use a specific model for market analysis
qllm ask --model gpt-4o-mini --provider openai "Analyze the potential market impact of electric vehicles in the next 5 years. Provide 3 key points."

# Stream a response for real-time content generation
qllm ask --stream --model gemma2:2b --provider ollama "Write a short blog post about the benefits of remote work."

# Describe a picture
qllm ask --stream --model llava:latest --provider ollama "Describe the picture" -i "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ca/Kowloon_Waterfront%2C_Hong_Kong%2C_2013-08-09%2C_DD_05.jpg/640px-Kowloon_Waterfront%2C_Hong_Kong%2C_2013-08-09%2C_DD_05.jpg"

# Chat
qllm chat --provider ollama --model gemma2:2b
```


These examples show how qllm-cli can be used for various business tasks, from content creation to market analysis.
