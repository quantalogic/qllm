            Each of five neighborhood dogs (Saber, Ginger, Nutmeg, Pepper, and Bear) is enjoying one of the following activities: 
            getting its ears scratched, playing catch, taking a nap, burying a chew toy, and going for a walk.
            Pepper is either playing catch or burying a chew toy.
            Neither Ginger, Saber, nor Bear is on a walk.
            One of the dogs named after a spice is getting its ears scratched.
            A dog not named for a spice is playing catch.
            Bear is getting some exercise.
            Can you determine what each dog is doing?

    ### The CoT Prompting Approach

    This prompt leverages Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning to systematically tackle complex problems. 

    In formal terms, given an input $$ x $$ and a target $$ y $$, a LLM $$ p $$ with CoT prompting can be expressed as:

    $$ y \sim \sum_{z \sim p(z|C_x)} p(y|C_x, z) \cdot p(z|C_x), $$

    where $$ C_x = c^{(cot)}(x) $$.

    - **$$ C_x $$**: Prompted input.
    - **$$ c^{(cot)}(\cdot) $$**: Template with CoT prompting instructions, e.g., ‘let’s think step by step’.
    - **$$ z $$**: Latent variable of rationale, representing a sampled rationale in natural language.

    This approach enables the LLM to decompose complex tasks into manageable reasoning steps.

    ### Let's Solve the Problem Step by Step

    **Question:** 

    <question>{{problem_to_solve}}</question>

    ---

    **Step 0: Define the Problem** 

    Reformulate the problem statement in your own words to ensure clarity. 

    - Reformulate all rules and constraints coherently.
    - Utilize predicate logic to define these rules.
    - Identify any implicit rules or constraints not explicitly stated.

    ***Step 1: Verify Your Reformulation*** 

    - Review each element of the problem to ensure consistency with your reformulation.
    - Revise as necessary until a clear and consistent reformulation is achieved.

    **Step 2: Identify Key Components** 

    - List at least 10 key components essential to addressing the problem.
    - Use clear bullet points to outline these components.

    <key_components> 
    - List essential elements relevant to the problem.
    - *Example:* If the problem is about climate change, key components might include greenhouse gases, renewable energy, and policy measures.
    </key_components>

    ---

    **Step 3: Break Down the Problem** 

    - Define at least 15 logical steps necessary to solve the problem using predicate logic.
    - Each step should clearly articulate the reasoning process.

    <logical_steps> 
    - <step number="1"> 
        **Define** the first logical step. 
        ***Example:*** "Identify the primary cause of the issue."
     </step>
    - <step number="2"> 
        **Identify** the next action or consideration. 
        ***Example:*** "Analyze the impact of the cause."
    </step>
    - <step number="3"> 
        **Outline** additional steps necessary for a comprehensive solution. 
        ***Example:*** "Propose mitigation strategies based on the analysis."
    </step>
    </logical_steps>

    ---

    **Step 4: Execute Logical Steps** 

    - Implement the logical steps defined previously and draw inferences.
    - Ensure each intermediate result is consistent with the problem statement and satisfies all requirements.
    - Repeat this step until a solution is reached.

    ---

    **Step 5: Synthesize Insights** 

    - Integrate insights from each step to formulate the final answer.
    - Analyze how each component interacts to contribute to the overall understanding of the problem.

    **Answer:**

    <final_answer> 
    - Present a clear, actionable, and definitive response based on synthesized insights.
    </final_answer>

    ### Additional Instructions for Agentic Behavior

    - **Take Initiative:** Propose additional questions or considerations that may arise.
    - **Be Decisive:** Provide actionable recommendations or next steps.
    - **Reflect on Implications:** Consider the broader impact of your answer on future decisions.
    - **Encourage Creativity:** Explore alternative solutions or approaches.
    - **Feedback Loop:** After providing an answer, reflect on your reasoning process for potential improvements.
